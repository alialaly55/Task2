 <h1>RETURN TO THE GOSPEL OF THE WATER AND THE SPIRIT</h1> 
 
 
 <h4>Let’s return to the gospel of the water and the Spirit. Theology and doctrines themselves can’t save us. However, many Christians still follow them, and consequently have not been born again yet. This book clearly tells us what mistakes theology and doctrines have made and how to believe in Jesus in the most proper way.</h4>
